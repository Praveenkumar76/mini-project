     <h3> About Us</h3>

<p>Welcome to Clinical Guidance System, Where healthcare and technology unite for a brighter, healthier tomorrow..
</p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>

    <p>We believe that healthcare information should be available to everyone, not just as a luxury, but as a basic right. Our journey started with one simple idea: to give people the knowledge and tools they need to better manage their health.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>We are data science students working on a mini project with a shared goal: to make healthcare information more accessible and easier to understand. Even though we are a small team, we have a strong passion for using data and technology to improve healthcare.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>Our goal is to create a simple, user-friendly platform that uses artificial intelligence to help you understand your health. By entering your symptoms, location, climate, our system predicts potential health issues and provides educational resources to increase your health knowledge.</p>
<h3>How We Do It</h3>
    <p>Weâ€™ve developed our platform using a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of symptoms, location, climate, medication, precaution and diseases. When you input your symptoms, location, climate, the system predicts possible health concerns, helping you make better decisions about your health.</p>
<h3>Your Well-being, Our Priority</h3>
        <p>Your health is our main focus. We understand that healthcare can be complex, which is why we offer not just predictions but also detailed information about each condition. You'll find tips on managing symptoms, medications, precautions, diet, and exercise to support your health journey.</p>
<h3>Join Us on This Journey</h3>
    <p>We invite you to explore our platform, learn from our resources, and take control of your health. Together, we can change how people access and understand healthcare information.</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing Clinical Guidance System as your trusted health companion. We are here to empower you with knowledge, support, and a healthier future.</p>
